        <h2 class="content-card-title" >Evolution from SQAAF</h2>

        <p class="content-text">
          The SQAAF framework established structured benchmarks for assessing
          school quality across CBSE-affiliated institutions. Insights gained
          from its implementation highlighted the need for sustained support
          beyond assessment.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          SQAA+ addresses this need by strengthening mentoring partnerships,
          peer learning, and continuous assurance mechanisms to support
          long-term institutional growth.
